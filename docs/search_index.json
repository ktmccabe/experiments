"],["rsetup.html", "1.1 Setup in R", " 1.1 Setup in R Goal By the end of the first week of the course, you will want to have R and RStudio installed on your computer (both free) and feel comfortable using R as a calculator. R is an application that processes the R programming language in a statistical computing environment. RStudio is also an application, which serves as a user interface that makes working in R easier. We will primarily open and use RStudio to work with R. In other classes, you may come across Stata, SPSS, Excel, or SAS, which are programs that also conduct data analysis. R has the advantage of being free and open-source. Even after you leave the university setting, you will be able to use R/RStudio for free. As an open-source program, it is very flexible, and a community of active R/RStudio users is constantly adding to and improving the program. R and RStudio Installation This content follows and reinforces QSS 1.3 by Kosuke Imai. Additional resources are also linked below. This video from Professor Christopher Bail explains why many social scientists use R and describes the R and RStudio installation process. This involves Going to cran, select the link that matches your operating system, and then follow the installation instructions, and Visiting RStudio and follow the download and installation instructions. R is the statistical software and programming language used for analysis. RStudio provides a convenient user interface for running R code. "],["first-time-working-in-r-and-rstudio.html", "1.2 First Time Working in R and RStudio", " 1.2 First Time Working in R and RStudio This next section provides a few notes on using R and RStudio now that you have installed it. In this section, we cover the following materials: Using R as a calculator and assigning objects using &lt;- Setting your working directory and the setwd() function. Creating and saving an R script 1.2.1 Open RStudio RStudio is an open-source and free program that greatly facilitates the use of R, especially for users new to programming. Once you have downloaded and installed R and RStudio, to work in R, all you need to do now is open RStudio (it will open R). It should look like this, though your version numbers will be different: Note: The first time you open RStudio, you likely only have the three windows above. We will want to create a fourth window by opening an R script to create the fourth window. To do this, in RStudio, click on File -&gt; New -&gt; R script in your computer’s toolbar. This will open a blank document for text editing in the upper left of the RStudio window. We will return to this window in a moment. You can alternatively click on the green + sign indicator in the top-left corner of the RStudio window, which should give you the option to create a new R script document. Now you should have something that looks like this, similar to Figure 1.1. in QSS: The upper-left window has our script document that will contain code. The lower-left window is the console. This will show the output of the code we run. We will also be able to type directly in the console. The upper-right window shows the environment (and other tabs, such as the history of commands). When we load and store data in RStudio, we will see a summary of that in the environment. The lower-right window will enable us to view plots and search help files, among other things. 1.2.2 Using R as a Calculator The bottom left window in your RStudio is the Console. You can type in this window to use R as a calculator or to try out commands. It will show the raw output of any commands you type. For example, we can try to use R as a calculator. Type the following in the Console (the bottom left window) and hit “enter” or “return” on your keyboard: 5 + 3 ## [1] 8 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 5^2 ## [1] 25 5 * 3 ## [1] 15 5/3 ## [1] 1.666667 (5 + 3) * 2 ## [1] 16 In the other RStudio windows, the upper right will show a history of commands that you have sent from the text editor to the R console, along with other items. The lower right will show graphs, help documents and other features. These will be useful later in the course. 1.2.3 Working in an R Script Earlier, I asked you to open an R script in the upper left window by doing File, then New File, then R Script. Let’s go back to working in that window. Set your working directory setwd() (Almost) every time you work in RStudio, the first thing you will do is set your working directory. This is a designated folder in your computer where you will save your R scripts and datasets. There are many ways to do this. An easy way is to go to Session -&gt; Set Working Directory -&gt; Choose Directory. I suggest choosing a folder in your computer that you can easily find and that you will routinely use for this class. Go ahead and create/select it. Note: when you selected your directory, code came out in the bottom left Console window. This is the setwd() command which can also be used directly to set your working directory in the future. If you aren’t sure where your directory has been set, you can also type getwd() in your Console. Try it now ## Example of where my directory was getwd() If I want to change the working directory, I can go to the top toolbar of my computer and use Session -&gt; Set Working Directory -&gt; Choose Directory or just type my file pathway using the setwd() below: ## Example of setting the working directory using setwd(). ## Your computer will have your own file path. setwd(&quot;/Users/ktmccabe/Dropbox/Rutgers Teaching/&quot;) Saving the R Script Let’s now save our R script to our working directory and give it an informative name. To do so, go to File, then Save As, make sure you are in the same folder on your computer as the folder you chose for your working directory. Give the file an informative name, such as: “McCabeWeek1.R”. Note: all of your R scripts will have the .R extension. 1.2.4 Preparing your R script Now that we have saved our R script, let’s work inside of it. Remember, we are in the top-left RStudio window now. Just like the beginning of a paper, you will want to title your R script. In R, any line that you start with a # will not be treated as a programming command. You can use this to your advantage to write titles/comments. Below is a screenshot example of a template R script. You can specify your working directory at the top, too. Add your own filepath inside setwd() Then you can start answering problems in the rest of the script. Think of the R script as where you write the final draft of your paper. In the Console (the bottom-left window), you can mess around and try different things, like you might when you are taking notes or outlining an essay. Then, write the final programming steps that lead you to your answer in the R script. For example, if I wanted to add 5 + 3, I might try different ways of typing it in the Console, and then when I found out 5 + 3 is the right approach, I would type that into my script. 1.2.5 Executing Commands in your R script The last thing we will note in this initial handout is how to execute commands in your R script. To run / execute a command in your R script (the upper left window), you can Highlight the code you want to run, and then hold down “command + return” on a Mac or “control + enter” on Windows Place your cursor at the end of the line of code (far right), and hit “command + return” on a Mac or “control + return” on Windows, or Do 1 or 2, but instead of using the keyboard to execute the commands, click “Run” in the top right corner of the upper-left window. Try it: Type 5 + 3 in the R script. Then, try to execute 5 + 3. It should look something like this: After you executed the code, you should see it pop out in your Console: 5 + 3 ## [1] 8 Note: The symbol # also allows for annotation behind commands or on a separate line. Everything that follows # will be ignored by R. You can annotate your own code so that you and others can understand what each part of the code is designed to do. ## Example sum53 &lt;- 5 + 3 # example of assigning an addition calculation 1.2.6 Objects Sometimes we will want to store our calculations as “objects” in R. We use &lt;- to assign objects by placing it to the left of what we want to store. For example, let’s store the calculation 5 + 3 as an object named sum53: sum53 &lt;- 5 + 3 After we execute this code, sum53 now stores the calculation. This means, that if we execute a line of code that just hassum53`, it will output 8. Try it: sum53 ## [1] 8 Now we no longer have to type 5 + 3, we can just type sum53. For example, let’s say we wanted to subtract 2 from this calculation. We could do: sum53 - 2 ## [1] 6 Let’s say we wanted to divide two stored calculations: ten &lt;- 5 + 5 two &lt;- 1 + 1 ten / two ## [1] 5 The information stored does not have to be numeric. For example, it can be a word, or what we would call a character string, in which case you need to use quotation marks. mccabe &lt;- &quot;professor for this course&quot; mccabe ## [1] &quot;professor for this course&quot; Note: Object names cannot begin with numbers and no spacing is allowed. Avoid using special characters such as % and $, which have specific meanings in R. Finally, use concise and intuitive object names. GOOD CODE: practice.calc &lt;- 5 + 3 BAD CODE: meaningless.and.unnecessarily.long.name &lt;- 5 + 3 While these are simple examples, we will use objects all the time for more complicated things to store (e.g., like full datasets!) throughout the course. We can also store an array or “vector” of information using c() somenumbers &lt;- c(3, 6, 8, 9) somenumbers ## [1] 3 6 8 9 Importance of Clean Code Ideally, when you are done with your R script, you should be able to highlight the entire script and execute it without generating any error messages. This means your code is clean. Code with typos in it may generate a red error message in the Console upon execution. This can happen when there are typos or commands are misused. For example, R is case sensitive. Let’s say we assigned our object like before: sum53 &lt;- 5 + 3 However, when we went to execute sum53, we accidentally typed Sum53: Sum53 ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;Sum53&#39; not found Only certain types of objects can be used in mathematical calculations. Let’s say we tried to divide mccabe by 2: mccabe / 2 ## Error in mccabe/2: non-numeric argument to binary operator A big part of learning to use R will be learning how to troubleshoot and detect typos in your code that generate error messages. 1.2.7 Practice with R Scripts Below is an exercise that will demonstrate you are able to use R as a calculator and create R scripts. Create an R script saved as ``LastnameSetup1.R” (use your last name). Within the R script, follow the example from this handout and title the script. Set your working directory, and include the file pathway (within setwd()) at the top of your .R script. Do the calculation 8 + 3 - 2 in R. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer. Do the calculation 5 x 3 in R. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer. Add these two calculations together. Note: do this by adding together the objects you created, not the underlying raw calculations. Report the answer. 1.2.8 Loading data into R Often the variables we care about are stored inside of rectangular datasets, like the dataset on turnout below from QSS Chapter 1. These have a number of rows nrow() and columns ncol() Each row is an “observation,” representing the information collected from an individual or entity Each column is a variable, representing a changing characteristic across multiple observations When we import a dataset into R, we have a few options. This highlights key elements of QSS section 1.3.5, which provides an overview of loading data into R with an example using UN population data. Option 1: Download dataset to your computer Move the dataset to your working directory Identify the file type (e.g., csv, dta, RData, txt) Pick the appropriate R function to match the type (e.g., read.csv(), read.dta(), load(), read.table()) Assign the dataset to an object. This object will now be class() of data.frame ## The turnout dataset is available in the week 2 Canvas module turnout &lt;- read.csv(&quot;turnout.csv&quot;) With a recent update to R, many people now add an argument to their code when loading in .csv files, which makes it easier to work with categorical variables. turnout &lt;- read.csv(&quot;turnout.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = T) There are also packages that exist, which simplify loading different types of data. Example: install.packages(&quot;rio&quot;, dependencies = T) Once you’ve installed it, you can load the package with library(). While you only need to install the package once, you need to use library() in each script where you use import. library(rio) turnout &lt;- import(&quot;turnout.csv&quot;) Option 2: Read file from a url provided Need an active internet connection for this to work Need friendly file type URL generally must be public Include the url inside the function used to read the data turnout &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktmccabe/teachingdata/main/turnout.csv&quot;) class(turnout) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; You can also open up a window to view the data: View(turnout) And you can view the first few rows with head() head(turnout) ## year VEP VAP total ANES felons noncit overseas osvoters ## 1 1980 159635 164445 86515 71 802 5756 1803 NA ## 2 1982 160467 166028 67616 60 960 6641 1982 NA ## 3 1984 167702 173995 92653 74 1165 7482 2361 NA ## 4 1986 170396 177922 64991 53 1367 8362 2216 NA ## 5 1988 173579 181955 91595 70 1594 9280 2257 NA ## 6 1990 176629 186159 67859 47 1901 10239 2659 NA Note that the columns are the variables, and each row contains the values corresponding to the variables for different units in the data. Here, each row is an election year. In many datasets we will work with, each row will be an experimental subject. We can access specific columns in the data using the $ attached to the dataframe name. For example, the code below displays all of the values from the year variable in the turnout dataframe: turnout$year ## [1] 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2008 This will be useful when we want to summarize particular variables, such as by finding the median. median(turnout$year) ## [1] 1993 "],["r-markdown.html", "1.3 R Markdown", " 1.3 R Markdown An R Markdown document, which you can create in RStudio, allows you to weave together regular text, R code, and the output of R code in the same document. This can be very convenient when conducting data analysis because it allows you more space to explain what you are doing in each step. It can also be an effective platform for writing a report on a data analysis, similar to what you do when you write up a problem set. It can also be useful for organizing replication files to post after you publish a paper. R Markdown documents can be “compiled” into html, pdf, or docx documents. Below is an example of what a compiled html file looks like. Note that the image has both written text and a gray chunk, within which there is some R code, as well as the output of the R code (e.g., the number 8 and the image of the histogram plot) We say this is a “compiled” RMarkdown document because it differs from the raw version of the file, which is a .Rmd file format. Below is an example of what the raw .Rmd version looks like, compared to the compiled html version. 1.3.1 How to get setup in RMarkdown Just like with a regular R script, to work in RMarkdown, you will open up RStudio. The first time you will be working in RMarkdown, you will want to install two packages: rmarkdown and knitr. You can do this in the Console window in RStudio. Type the following into the Console window and hit enter/return. install.packages(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;) install.packages(&quot;knitr&quot;) Once you have those installed, now, each time you want to create an RMarkdown document, you will open up a .Rmd R Markdown file and get to work. Go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown in RStudio Alternatively, you can click the green + symbol at the top left of your RStudio window This should open up a window with several options, similar to the image below Create an informative title and change the author name to match your own For now, we will keep the file type as html. In the future, you can create pdf or .doc documents. However, these require additional programs installed on your computer. After you hit “OK” a new .Rmd script file will open in your top-left window with some template language and code chunks, similar to the image below. Save as .Rmd file. Save the file by going to “File -&gt; Save as” in RStudio Give the file an informative name like your LastnamePractice1.Rmd Key Components. Now you are ready to work within the Rmd script file. We will point to four basic components of this file, and you can build your knowledge of RMarkdown from there. The top part bracketed by --- on top and bottom is the YAML component. This tells RStudio the pertinent information about how to “compile” the Rmd file. Most of the time you can leave this alone, but you can always edit the title, author, or date as you wish. The next component are the global options for the document. It is conveniently labeled “setup.” By default what this is saying is that the compiled version will “echo” (i.e., display all code chunks and output) unless you specifically specify otherwise. For example, note that it says include = FALSE for the setup chunk. That setting means that this code chunk will “run” but it will not appear in the nicely compiled .html file. Most of the time you will not need to edit those settings. The third component I want to bring attention to is the body text. The # symbol in RMarkdown is used to indicate that you have a new section of the document. For example, in the compiled images at the beginning, this resulted in the text being larger and bolded when it said “Problem 2.” In addition to just using a single #, using ## or ### can indicate subsections or subsubsections. Other than that symbol, you can generally write text just as you would in any word processing program, with some exceptions, such as how to make text bold or italicized. (See bottom of section for resources on the Markdown language.) The final component I want to call attention to are the other main body code chunks. These are specific parts of the document where you want to create a mini R script. To create these, you can simply click the + C symbol toward the top of the top left window of RStudio and indicate you want an R chunk. For example, in the image above, there is an R code chunk labeled cars. The cars component is just a label for the code chunk. Labeling code chunks is not necessary. By default, a new R code chunk will just have r in the brackets, and that is sufficient. Writing R Code. Within a code chunk, you can type R code just like you would in any R script. To run (“execute”) the R code, you can run a single line the exact same way you do in a regular R script by moving the cursor to the end of a line of code or highlighting a portion of code and hitting “Run.” However, in RMarkdown, you also have the option of running an entire code chunk at once by hitting the green triangle at the top-right of a given code chunk. Knitting the document. Once you have added a code chunk and/or some text, you are ready to compile or “Knit” the document. This is what generates the .html document. To do so, click on the Knit button toward the top of the top-left window of Rstudio. After a few moments, this should open up a preview window displaying the compiled html file. It will also save an actual .html file in your working directory (the same location on your computer where you have saved the .Rmd file) Try to locate this compiled .html file on your computer and open it. For most computers, .html files will open in your default web browser, such as Google Chrome or Safari. This step is a common place where errors are detected and generated. Sometimes the compiling process fails due to errors in the R code in your code chunks or an error in the Markdown syntax. If your document fails to knit, the next step is to try to troubleshoot the error messages the compiling process generates. The best way to reduce and more easily detect errors is to “knit as you go.” Try to knit your document after each chunk of code you create. 1.3.2 Additional RMarkdown resources Here are a few additional resources for working with RMarkdown. This website provides some basic syntax for the Markdown language, such as how to display bulleted lists and how to bold or italicize text. This page walks through the setup of RMarkdown documents similar to what the course notes just did. This provides a second set of instructions and additional examples of settings you can use to customize your RMarkdown output (e.g., how large figures are when they are displayed). This page talks more about compiling aka rendering aka knitting Rmd documents into different formats, such as html, pdf, or Word doc files. 1.3.3 Practice with R Markdown Below is an exercise that will demonstrate you are able to use R as a calculator and compile RMarkdown documents. Create an Rmd file saved as “LastnameSetup1.Rmd” (use your last name). Provide an informative title for the document. Create a section labeled “Problems.” Create a code chunk where you do the calculation 8 + 3 - 2 in R. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer as text underneath the code chunk. In a second code chunk, do the calculation 5 x 3 in R. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer as text underneath the code chunk.. In a third code chunk, add these two calculations together. Note: do this by adding together the objects you created, not the underlying raw calculations. Report the answer as text underneath the code chunk.. Knit the file to create an html document. Open the html document in a web browser to check the formatting. "],["what-are-experiments.html", "1.4 What are experiments?", " 1.4 What are experiments?

A few definitions: The sample average is a random variable, a quantity that varies from sample to sample.1 Expected value is the average outcome of a random variable weighted by its probability of occurrence. Good news: Under random sampling, the expected value of a sample average is the population average. Similarly, the expectation of a randomly selected observation from the population is the population mean. Even though we have a sample, under random sampling, our sample will be unbiased. On average, it’s true.

We want our final statement to be \\(E[Y_i (1)]-E[Y_i (0)]=E[\\tau_i ]\\)=ATE Our final statement is: \\(E[Y_i(1) | D_i = 1] - E[Y_i(0) | D_i = 0]=E[\\widehat{ATE}]\\) Under what conditions can we get those two statements to look the same? Well, let’s look into some rules of expectation. \\(E[Y|X] = E[Y]\\) if Y and X are independent.2 Our final statement can be simplified when treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes: \\(E[Y_i(1) |D_i = 1] = E[Y_i(1) |D_i = 0] = E[Y_i(1)]\\) \\(E[Y_i(0) |D_i = 0] = E[Y_i(0) |D_i = 1] = E[Y_i(0)]\\) When does this occur? Random assignment of treatment!! Putting this together, under random assignment: \\[\\begin{align*} E[\\widehat{ATE}] &amp;= E[\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_1^m Y_i - \\frac{1}{N-m}\\sum_{m+1}^{N} Y_i ]\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_1^m E(Y_i) - \\frac{1}{N-m}\\sum_{m+1}^{N} E(Y_i ) \\\\ &amp;= E[Y_i(1) | D_i = 1] - E[Y_i(0) | D_i = 0] \\\\ &amp;= E[Y_i (1)]-E[Y_i (0)]=E[\\tau_i ]\\\\ E[\\widehat{ATE}] &amp;= ATE \\end{align*}\\] Why Experiments One approach for addressing the fundamental problem of causal inference is to simulate two potential states of the world through random assignment: Randomized Controlled Trials / Experiments Experiments approximate factual vs. counterfactual comparison We randomly assign one group to receive a “treatment” and another not to receive a treatment (the control) Using what we learned above, when treatment assignment is randomized, the only thing that distinguishes the treatment group from the control group in expectation, besides the treatment itself, is chance. This allows us to use a simple differences in means estimator in experiments to estimate our average treatment effects.

E.g., suppose we want to know the effect of minimum wage laws on unemployment. Laws aren’t randomly assigned Possible that states where unemployment (outcome) is lower are less likely to see minimum wage laws passed relative to states where unemployment is higher. If so, the potential outcomes \\(Y_i(0)\\) of states that would hypothetically be treated or untreated would not be the same.

A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination” by Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) Research Question: Does race influence hiring decisions? What are the potential outcomes? What is the approach? Audit study: “send fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. Treatment: Manipulate perceived race: resumes randomly assigned African-American- or White-sounding names. Outcomes: Does the resume get a callback? How should we estimate the average treatment effect? 2.6.1 Loading the data We will use data from Imai (2017) Chapter 2. Let’s load the data. Note: When we have variables that are text-based categories, we may want to tell R to treat these “strings” of text information as factor variables, a particular type of variable that represents data as a set of nominal (unordered) or ordinal (ordered) categories. We do this with the stringsAsFactors argument. resume &lt;- read.csv(&quot;resume.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = T) resume &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktmccabe/teachingdata/main/resume.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = T) Variables and Description firstname: first name of the fictitious job applicant sex: sex of applicant (female or male) race: race of applicant (black or white) call: whether a callback was made (1 = yes, 0 = no) The data contain 4870 resumes and 4 variables. nrow(resume) # number of rows ## [1] 4870 ncol(resume) # number of columns ## [1] 4 dim(resume) # number of rows and columns ## [1] 4870 4 head(resume) ## firstname sex race call ## 1 Allison female white 0 ## 2 Kristen female white 0 ## 3 Lakisha female black 0 ## 4 Latonya female black 0 ## 5 Carrie female white 0 ## 6 Jay male white 0 2.6.2 Variable classes We can check the class of each variable: Look, we have a new type, a “factor” variable. class(resume$firstname) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; class(resume$sex) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; class(resume$race) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; class(resume$call) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; Rules of Thumb Usually, we want character variables to store text (e.g., open-ended survey responses) We want numeric variables to store numbers. Usually, we want factor variables to store categories. Within R, factor variables assign a number to each category, which is given a label or level in the form of text. Categories might be ordinal or “ordered” (e.g., Very likely, Somewhat likely, Not likely) or Unordered (e.g., “male”, “female”) R won’t know if a factor variable is ordered or unordered. Alas, we have to be smarter than R. R might think you have a character variable when you want it to be a factor or the reverse. That’s when as.factor() and as.character() are useful. Always check class() to find out the variable type 2.6.3 Exploring Treatment and Control Groups We are going to use several different approaches to calculate our difference in means between treatment and control to help us explore R’s capabilities and common computational approaches. We can use the table command to see how many observations in our data fall into each category or numerical value. ## Example: how many black vs. white sounding resumes table(resume$race) ## ## black white ## 2435 2435 As mentioned, factor variables have levels: levels(resume$race) ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;white&quot; We can also use the table command to show a crosstabulation: a table that displays the frequency of observations across two variables. Because our outcome variable call is dichotomous and we are interested in the rates of callbacks, we might use a table to display this information. (For outcomes that are continuous, the table approach is less useful.) ## Example: how many black vs. white sounding resumes by call backs ## We can label the two dimensions of the table with the = table(calledback = resume$call, race = resume$race) ## race ## calledback black white ## 0 2278 2200 ## 1 157 235 Sometimes we will want to show the proportion instead of the frequency using prop.table ## Example: proportion black vs. white sounding resumes by call backs ## Convert to proportion prop.table(table(calledback = resume$call, race = resume$race), margin = 2) # 1 for row sum, 2 for col ## race ## calledback black white ## 0 0.93552361 0.90349076 ## 1 0.06447639 0.09650924 How can we interpret this crosstabulation? 2.6.4 Means with Relational Operators Goal: Compare callback rates for white sounding names to black sounding names, so we need to be able to filter by race. Good news: We have several relational operators in R that evaluate logical statements: ==, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, != We have a statement and R evaluates it as TRUE or FALSE ## for each observation, does the value of race equal &quot;black&quot;? resume$race == &quot;black&quot; By putting this logical statement within [ ], we are asking R to take the mean() of the variable resume$call for the subset of observations for which this logical statement is TRUE. mean(resume$call[resume$race == &quot;black&quot;]) ## [1] 0.06447639 Ultimately, each of these paths has led us to a place where we can estimate the average treatment effect by calculation the difference in means: the difference in callback rates for black and white applicants. We said the ATE = \\(\\bar{Y}(treatment) - \\bar{Y}(control)\\) ate &lt;- mean(resume$call[resume$race == &quot;black&quot;]) - mean(resume$call[resume$race == &quot;white&quot;]) ate ## [1] -0.03203285 How can we interpret this? Do white applicants have an advantage? 2.6.5 Means with tidyverse The tidyverse offers a suite of R functions and a different grammar or syntax of coding. Some people prefer this to the “base R” codes we did above. To use this suite, first install the tidyverse package: When you install a package, this is like downloading an app to your phone. You only have to do it one time. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) After you have a package installed, much like an app on your phone, you then need to open it before using it in R. To do so, use the library() command. library(tidyverse) The tidyverse works through these piping %&gt;% operators. We can read it from left to right. Take our dataset resume, group the data by race, and within each racial group, summarize the data by taking the mean call back rate. resume %&gt;% group_by(race) %&gt;% summarise(means = mean(call)) ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## race means ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 black 0.0645 ## 2 white 0.0965 We could go a step further to calculate the ATE. ate &lt;- resume %&gt;% group_by(race) %&gt;% summarise(means = mean(call)) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% spread(race, means)%&gt;% mutate(diff = black - white) ate ## # A tibble: 1 x 3 ## black white diff ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.0645 0.0965 -0.0320 2.6.6 ATE with linear regression Linear regression also offers a way to calculate the conditional means and difference in means between two groups. In R, we use lm() for this. The syntax is lm(y ~ x, data = mydataframe). fit &lt;- lm(call ~ race, data =resume) We can look at the coefficient results only. fit$coefficients ## (Intercept) racewhite ## 0.06447639 0.03203285 In a regression of this form, the intercept represents the mean of the reference category, in this case, the callback rate for Black applicants. The coefficient on racewhite represents the difference in means between the reference category and this group. I.e., going from a Black applicant (the reference category) to a white applicant, on average, increases call backs by 3.2 percentage points. 2.6.7 Subsetting data in R Maybe we are interested in differences in callbacks for females. One approach for looking at the treatment effect for female applicants, only, is to subset our data to include only female names. To do this, we will assign a new data.frame object that keeps only those rows where sex == \"female\" and retains all columns Below are two approaches for this subsetting, one that uses brackets and one that uses the subset function ## option one females &lt;- resume[resume$sex == &quot;female&quot;, ] ## option two using subset()- preferred females &lt;- subset(resume, sex == &quot;female&quot;) Now that we have subset the data, this simplifies estimating the ATE for female applicants only. We said the ATE = \\(\\bar{Y}(treatment) - \\bar{Y}(control)\\) ate.females &lt;- mean(females$call[females$race == &quot;black&quot;]) - mean(females$call[females$race == &quot;white&quot;]) ate.females ## [1] -0.03264689 Question: Is this an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect? Try on your own, then expand for the answer. This is an example of a “Conditional Average Treatment Effect.” Generally, because gender is a pre-treatment factor, we can condition on it and get unbiased estimates for the average treatment effect within a particular gender group. Random assignment of treatment means that in expectation, we should have about equal proportions of female applicants in each treatment group, ruling out the potential for selection bias. 2.6.8 Additional Practice We will use data from the article below: Thal, A. (2020). The desire for social status and economic conservatism among affluent Americans. American Political Science Review, 114(2), 426-442. In the experiment, affluent Americans are randomly assigned to encounter Facebook posts in which others broadcast their economic success. These posts are designed in a way that encourages affluent respondents to view economic success as a means of achieving social status. The experiment includes a sample of 2010 affluent Americans– people who report household incomes in the top 10 percent of the U.S. income distribution. Causal Question: Does desire for social status influence economic views of affluent Americans? Randomization: Randomly assign respondents to view different fictional Facebook posts designed to signal different motivations Outcome: An economic conservatism index based on respondents’ support for decreasing “taxes on households making $150,000 or more a year,” support for decreasing the “taxes on money people make from selling investments, also referred to as capital gains,” and support for decreasing “government regulation of business and industry.” Comparison: Average economic views between experimental conditions that vary in the type of social cues given. Let’s load the data! Here, note that the data file is in a .RData format instead of .csv. This means that instead of using read.csv, we should use a function to load the data that is suitable for the .RData format. This will be load. That function works the following way: load(&quot;status.RData&quot;) After running the above code, an object will show up in your R environment. head(status) ## condition male econcon ## 2 Concrete 1 0.7500000 ## 3 Self-Esteem 1 1.0000000 ## 4 Placebo 1 0.6666667 ## 5 Self-Esteem 0 0.2500000 ## 6 Self-Esteem 0 1.0000000 ## 7 Social Approval 0 0.8333333 The data include the following variables condition: Placebo, Concrete, Self-Esteem, Social Approval, Conspicuous Consumption gender: 1= male; 0= otherwise econcon: Economic views. Numeric variable from 0 to 1, with higher values reflecting more conservative views Practice: How many people are in each condition? What is the average treatment effect between the Placebo and Social Approval conditions? Try on your own, then expand for the answer. ## Number of observations table(status$condition) ## ## Placebo Concrete Conspicuous Consumption ## 394 391 392 ## Self-Esteem Social Approval ## 390 375 ## tidy groupmeans &lt;- status %&gt;% group_by(condition) %&gt;% summarise(means = mean(econcon)) %&gt;% ungroup %&gt;% spread(condition, means) groupmeans$`Social Approval` - groupmeans$Placebo ## [1] 0.05634969 ## relational operators ate &lt;- mean(status$econcon[status$condition == &quot;Social Approval&quot;]) - mean(status$econcon[status$condition == &quot;Placebo&quot;]) ate ## [1] 0.05634969 ## regression fit &lt;- lm(econcon ~ condition, data = status) fit$coefficients[&quot;conditionSocial Approval&quot;] ## conditionSocial Approval ## 0.05634969 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
